# Test Site Playground

## Purpose

This project is meant to practice site builds and javascript from this [Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-getting-started/table-of-contents) and beyond. 

Starter files used [here](https://github.com/pluralsight/web-dev-starter).

## Notes from the starter file Project:

- You will need to have Node installed to start this environment. If you are not sure if you have Node installed run `node -v` in your terminal. If you do not see a version number output, install Node before moving on.
- Install light-server locally and save it to your development environment by running `npm install lite-server --save-dev` in your terminal.
- Run `npm run start` in your terminal to start the server.
- Your browser will open at `localhost:3000`.
